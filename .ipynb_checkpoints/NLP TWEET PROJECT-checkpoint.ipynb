    "# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview/Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The landscape of traditional advertising has changed dramatically, with many companies now employing highly targeted strategies. By understanding customer demographics, businesses can communicate more directly and effectively. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook offer a direct channel for consumers to share their opinions about brands, products, and services. While this real-time feedback is invaluable, managing the sheer volume of messages can be challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumers frequently use social media to share their thoughts, presenting companies with the challenge of extracting actionable insights from the overwhelming amount of data. For example, during SXSW 2011, Apple and Google introduced numerous new products and services, resulting in a flood of tweets. Sifting through thousands of unlabeled tweets to gain meaningful insights is a significant challenge for companies like Apple.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Aim and Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims to assist companies such as Apple and Google by developing a predictive classification model that can analyze tweets. This model will categorize the sentiment of tweets as \"Positive\" or \"Not positive\" (including neutral or sentiment-lacking tweets). By doing so, companies can better organize and utilize the information embedded in the tweets they receive during events like SXSW or in their regular social media interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary stakeholders in this project are companies like Apple and Google, which will benefit from an enhanced ability to understand consumer sentiment. Secondary stakeholders include marketing teams, product managers, and customer service departments that can leverage these insights for better decision-making and strategy formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This classification model offers numerous benefits, particularly by identifying \"Positive\" tweets about Apple and Google products:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gauging public opinion\n",
    "2. Obtaining direct consumer feedback\n",
    "3. Retraining the model on custom datasets for specific products or regions\n",
    "4. Understanding target demographics\n",
    "    - Identifying individuals who show positive interest\n",
    "    - Tailoring advertising strategies more effectively\n",
    "    - Facilitating advertising within social media circles of existing fans, enhancing outreach and engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "The project has the potential to transform how companies interact with and respond to consumer feedback on social media, providing valuable insights and fostering better consumer relationships."

    "# 2.0 DATA UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "\n",
    "To build an effective NLP model for analyzing Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products, we need to thoroughly understand the dataset and its properties. The dataset in question comes from CrowdFlower via data.world and contains over 9,000 tweets that have been rated by human raters as positive, negative, or neither. Below is a detailed breakdown of the data understanding process:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1. Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 9,093 tweets related to technology products and brands, with a focus on Apple and Google products. The data was collected during and after the 2011 South by Southwest (SXSW) Conference. Each tweet has been pre-labeled by human raters for sentiment analysis and product and brand identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Source of Data and Suitability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project originates from CrowdFlower, now known as Figure Eight, and was subsequently made available on data.world .Kent Cavender-Bares contributed this valuable resource on August 30, 2013, sharing it with the data science community.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is contained in a CSV file named \"judge-1377884607_tweet_product_company.csv\", which serves as the primary source for our analysis. This file contains a wealth of information about consumer sentiments towards technology products, particularly focusing on tweets related to Apple and Google during the 2011 South by Southwest (SXSW) Conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suitability**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is highly relevant for the project as it specifically contains tweets about Apple and Google products, aligning perfectly with the project's aim.\n",
    "The manual sentiment ratings (positive, negative, or neither) provide a robust foundation for training a sentiment analysis model.\n",
    "Raters judged if the tweet's text expressed a positive, negative, or no emotion towards a brand . When an emotion was expressed, the rater identified the brand that was the target of that emotion.\n",
    "## 2.3. Data Size and Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comprises over 9,000 tweets, which is a substantial amount for training an NLP model. This size is generally sufficient to capture a wide range of sentiment expressions and variations in language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structures**\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting data file contains three columns per row:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) tweet_text: The actual content of the tweet\n",
    "\n",
    "b) emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at: The product or brand the emotion is directed at (if identifiable)\n",
    "\n",
    "c) is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product: The sentiment of the tweet (Positive, Negative, or No emotion)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4. Feature Inclusion and Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "Tweet Text: The primary feature for sentiment analysis. The content of the tweet will be tokenized and transformed into numerical representations (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings) for model training.\n",
    "Emotion Expressed: The target variable for the model, indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neither.\n",
    "Target Product/Brand: This feature can provide additional context and help in understanding the sentiment in relation to specific products or brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The tweet text is directly relevant as it contains the information needed to determine sentiment.\n",
    "The emotion expressed is essential for supervised learning, providing the ground truth for model training and evaluation.\n",
    "The target product/brand feature can help in fine-tuning the model to understand sentiment in the context of specific products or brands, which is particularly useful for companies like Apple and Google.\n",
    "2.5. Data Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Imbalance: The dataset has a significant imbalance in sentiment classes (e.g., There was overwhelmingly neutral with very few examples of negative sentiment.), this could affect model performance. Techniques such as resampling or class weighting may be necessary.\n",
    "Noise and Ambiguity: Tweets often contain slang, abbreviations, and emojis, which can introduce noise and ambiguity. Preprocessing steps like text normalization and the use of advanced NLP techniques can help mitigate this.\n",
    "Contextual Understanding: Tweets are short and may lack context, making it challenging to accurately determine sentiment. Incorporating additional context or using models capable of understanding nuanced language (e.g., transformers) can improve performance.\n",
    "By thoroughly understanding the dataset and addressing its limitations, we can build a robust NLP model to analyze Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products. This model will help companies like Apple and Google gain valuable insights from social media feedback, enhancing their ability to respond to consumer sentiment effectively."

    "# 3.0 DATA EXPLORATION\n",
    "Before diving into model building, let's get acquainted with our training data. By exploring its characteristics, we can uncover valuable insights. This exploration will focus on key aspects like data types, missing values (null values), the frequency of different values (value counts), and the spread of classes (for classification tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1. Data Types\n",
    "Understanding the data types of each feature is crucial for preprocessing and model building. We'll check the data types of all columns in the dataset to ensure they are appropriate for the tasks ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2. Missing Values (Null Values)\n",
    "Missing values can significantly impact model performance. We'll identify columns with missing values and determine the best strategies to handle them, such as imputation or removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. 3. Value Counts\n",
    "Analyzing the frequency of different values in categorical columns can provide insights into the distribution of the data. We'll perform value counts for key columns to understand their distributions better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. 4. Spread of Classes\n",
    "For classification tasks, it's essential to understand the distribution of the target variable. We'll examine the spread of sentiment classes (positive, negative, neither) to check for class imbalances and plan appropriate strategies if needed."
